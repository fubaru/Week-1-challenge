# HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

## Description

Learned to find semantic HTML elements and understand the logical structure of the elements separate from the sytling and positioning. At the end of the project, I was able to correlate which elements correspond to the selectors in the CSS style file. Identify the sequencial order that sets precedence for the CSS selectors were crucial to complete the project, and consolidating similar selectors with the same codes cleaned up the CSS file.
